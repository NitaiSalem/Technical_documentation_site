                <h2>What is machine learning? </h2>
            </header>
            <p>Machine learning is a branch of <code>artificial intelligence</code> (AI) focused on building
                applications that learn
                from data and improve their accuracy over time without being programmed to do so.

                In data science, an algorithm is a sequence of statistical processing steps. In machine learning,
                algorithms are 'trained' to find patterns and features in massive amounts of data in order to make
                decisions and predictions based on new data. The better the algorithm, the more accurate the decisions
                and predictions will become as it processes more data.
            </p>

            <p>
                Today, examples of machine learning are all around us. Digital assistants search the web and play music
                in response to our voice commands. Websites recommend products and movies and songs based on what we
                bought, watched, or listened to before. Robots vacuum our floors while we do . . . something better with
                our time. Spam detectors stop unwanted emails from reaching our inboxes. Medical image analysis systems
                help doctors spot tumors they might have missed. And the first self-driving cars are hitting the road.

                We can expect more. As big data keeps getting bigger, as computing becomes more powerful and affordable,
                and as data scientists keep developing more capable algorithms, machine learning will drive greater and
                greater efficiency in our personal and work lives. </p>

                <h2>How machine learning works</h2>
            </header>
            <p>There are four basic steps for building a machine learning application (or model). These are typically
                performed by data scientists working closely with the business professionals for whom the model is being
                developed.</p>
            <p>
                Step 1: Select and prepare a training data set
                Training data is a data set representative of the data the machine learning model will ingest to solve
                the problem it’s designed to solve. In some cases, the training data is labeled data—‘tagged’ to call
                out features and classifications the model will need to identify. Other data is unlabeled, and the model
                will need to extract those features and assign classifications on its own.

                In either case, the training data needs to be properly prepared—randomized, de-duped, and checked for
                imbalances or biases that could impact the training. It should also be divided into two subsets: the
                training subset, which will be used to train the application, and the evaluation subset, used to test
                and refine it.</p>

            <p>Step 2: Choose an algorithm to run on the training data set
                Again, an algorithm is a set of statistical processing steps. The type of algorithm depends on the type
                (labeled or unlabeled) and amount of data in the training data set and on the type of problem to be
                solved.

                Common types of machine learning algorithms for use with labeled data include the following:

                Regression algorithms: Linear and logistic regression are examples of <code>regression algorithms
                </code> used to
                understand relationships in data. Linear regression is used to predict the value of a dependent variable
                based on the value of an independent variable. Logistic regression can be used when the dependent
                variable is binary in nature: A or B. For example, a linear regression algorithm could be trained to
                predict a salesperson’s annual sales (the dependent variable) based on its relationship to the
                salesperson’s education or years of experience (the independent variables.) Another type of regression
                algorithm called a support vector machine is useful when dependent variables are more difficult to
                classify.

                <p>
                    Decision trees: Decision trees use classified data to make recommendations based on a set of
                    decision
                    rules. For example, a decision tree that recommends betting on a particular horse to win, place, or
                    show
                    could use data about the horse (e.g., age, winning percentage, pedigree) and apply rules to those
                    factors to recommend an action or decision.
                    Instance-based algorithms: A good example of an instance-based algorithm is <code> K-Nearest
                        Neighbor
                    </code>or k-nn.
                    It uses classification to estimate how likely a data point is to be a member of one group or another
                    based on its proximity to other data points.
                    Algorithms for use with unlabeled data include the following:

                    Clustering algorithms: Think of clusters as groups. Clustering focuses on identifying groups of
                    similar
                    records and labeling the records according to the group to which they belong. This is done without
                    prior
                    knowledge about the groups and their characteristics. Types of clustering algorithms include the
                    K-means, TwoStep, and Kohonen clustering.
                    Association algorithms: Association algorithms find patterns and relationships in data and identify
                    frequent ‘if-then’ relationships called association rules. These are similar to the rules used in
                    data
                    mining.
                </p>
                <p>
                Neural networks: A neural network is an algorithm that defines a layered network of calculations
                featuring an input layer, where data is ingested; at least one hidden layer, where calculations are
                performed make different conclusions about input; and an output layer. where each conclusion is assigned
                a probability. A deep neural network defines a network with multiple hidden layers, each of which
                successively refines the results of the previous layer. (For more, see the “Deep learning” section
                below.)</p>


            <p>different types of algorithms include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Regression algorithms</li>
                <li>Decision trees</li>
                <li>Instance-based algorithms</li>
                <li>Association algorithms</li>
                <li>Neural networks</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Step 3: Training the algorithm to create the model
                Training the algorithm is an iterative process–it involves running variables through the algorithm,
                comparing the output with the results it should have produced, adjusting weights and biases within the
                algorithm that might yield a more accurate result, and running the variables again until the algorithm
                returns the correct result most of the time. The resulting trained, accurate algorithm is the machine
                learning model—an important distinction to note, because 'algorithm' and 'model' are incorrectly used
                interchangeably, even by machine learning mavens.</p>

            <p>Supervised machine learning
                Supervised machine learning trains itself on a labeled data set. That is, the data is labeled with
                information that the machine learning model is being built to determine and that may even be classified
                in ways the model is supposed to classify data. For example, a <code>computer vision model
                </code>designed to
                identify purebred German Shepherd dogs might be trained on a data set of various labeled dog images.
            </p>
            <p>Supervised machine learning requires less training data than other machine learning methods and makes
                training easier because the results of the model can be compared to actual labeled results. But,
                properly labeled data is expensive to prepare, and there's the danger of overfitting, or creating a
                model so closely tied and biased to the training data that it doesn't handle variations in new data
                accurately.</p>

                <h2>Reinforcement machine learning</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Reinforcement machine learning is a behavioral machine learning model that is similar to supervised
                learning, but the algorithm isn’t trained using sample data. This model learns as it goes by using trial
                and error. A sequence of successful outcomes will be reinforced to develop the best recommendation or
                policy for a given problem.</p>

            <p>Deep learning is a subset of machine learning (all deep learning is machine learning, but not all machine
                learning is deep learning). Deep learning algorithms define an artificial neural network that is
                designed to learn the way the human brain learns. Deep learning models require large amounts of data
                that pass through multiple layers of calculations, applying weights and biases in each successive layer
                to continually adjust and improve the outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Deep learning models are typically unsupervised or semi-supervised. <code>Reinforcement learning
                    models</code> can
                also be deep learning models. Certain types of deep learning models—including convolutional neural
                networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs)—are driving progress in areas such as computer
                vision, natural language processing (including speech recognition), and self-driving cars. </p>

                <h2>Real-world machine learning use cases</h2>
            </header>
            <p>As noted at the outset, machine learning is everywhere. Here are just a few examples of machine learning
                you might encounter every day:

                Digital assistants: Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and other digital assistants are powered
                by natural language processing (NLP), a machine learning application that enables computers to process
                text and voice data and 'understand' human language the way people do. Natural language processing also
                drives voice-driven applications like GPS and speech recognition (speech-to-text) software.
                Recommendations: Deep learning models drive 'people also liked' and 'just for you' recommendations
                offered by Amazon, Netflix, Spotify, and other retail, entertainment, travel, job search, and news
                services.</p>
